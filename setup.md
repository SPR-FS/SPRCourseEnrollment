# Setup Guide

This guide walks you through the complete initial setup of a Course Enrollment system. Complete every section in order before accepting student enrollment requests.

---

## Prerequisites

- **GitHub Organization** 
   - https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch 
- **GitHub account** that is an **owner** of the organization you're using for this (or has org admin + repo admin on all relevant repos)
- **GitHub CLI** installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`)
- **Git** installed and configured
- Admin access to create repositories and secrets in your organization

---

## 1. Create the Enrollment Repository

If this repository does not already exist in the organization:

```bash
gh repo create YourOrganizationName/RepositoryNameForCourseEnrollment --private --confirm-init
```

Then push this project's code to it:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/SPR-FS/SPRCourseEnrollment.git
git push -u origin main
```

> If you cloned this repo from an existing remote, skip this step.

---

## 2. Create Template Repositories

The provision workflow creates student repos from templates (see the `LABS` variable in `provision.yml`). Each template must:

1. **Exist** in your organization.
2. Be marked as a **template repository** (Settings > "Template repository" checkbox).

To create a template repo and mark it as a template:

```bash
gh repo create YourOrganizationName/LabName --private --template=false
# Repeat for however many lab repositories you have
```

Then in the GitHub UI for each repo: **Settings** > check **Template repository**.

Or via the API:

```bash
gh api --method PATCH /repos/YourOrganizationName/LabName -f is_template=true
```

> **Important:** The `is_template` flag must be `true` on every template repo. The `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/generate` endpoint will fail otherwise.

---

## 3. Create the `ORG_ADMIN_TOKEN`

The workflow uses a Personal Access Token (PAT) stored as `ORG_ADMIN_TOKEN` to create repos from templates, add collaborators, set topics, clone/push, and create pull requests — all across the organization.

### Option A: Classic PAT (recommended for simplicity)

1. Go to **GitHub > Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)**
2. Click **Generate new token (classic)**
3. Set an appropriate expiration (e.g. end of the semester)
4. Select the **`repo`** scope (this covers all needed permissions: contents, issues, pull requests, collaborators, administration, topics)
5. Generate and copy the token

### Option B: Fine-Grained PAT (more secure, more setup)

1. Go to **GitHub > Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Fine-grained tokens**
2. Click **Generate fine-grained token**
3. Set **Resource owner** to `FullSailGameStudies`
4. Set **Repository access** to **All repositories** (or select every template + enrollment repo)
5. Under **Repository permissions**, grant:
   - **Administration: Read and write** — create repos from templates, add collaborators, set topics
   - **Contents: Read and write** — clone repos, push branches
   - **Issues: Read and write** — edit issue body (redaction), comment, close
   - **Pull requests: Read and write** — create grading PRs
   - **Metadata: Read-only** — mandatory companion permission (auto-granted)
6. Generate and copy the token

> **Note:** The token owner must be a **member** (or owner) of the organization. The `generate` template endpoint requires org membership.

---

## 4. Add the Token as a Repository Secret

Add the PAT from step 3 as a secret named `ORG_ADMIN_TOKEN` in the enrollment repository:

```bash
gh secret set ORG_ADMIN_TOKEN --repo YourOrganizationName/RepositoryNameForCourseEnrollment
# Paste the token when prompted, then press Enter
```

Verify it was saved:

```bash
gh secret list --repo YourOrganizationName/RepositoryNameForCourseEnrollment
```

You should see `ORG_ADMIN_TOKEN` in the list.

This can also be done in the Github UI. 
1. On Github navigate to your enrollment repository's settings, RepositoryNameForCourseEnrollment > Settings
2. Secrets and Variables > Actions
3. Then click 'New Repository Secret'
4. Name the secret ORG_ADMIN_TOKEN and paste the token in the Secret section.
5. Click 'Add Secret'

---

## 5. Create and Configure the App

We need to create a GitHub App under the organization to authorize access to the private template repositories in the provisioning script

1. On GitHub navigate to your enrollment repository's settings, RepositoryNameForCourseEnrollment > Settings
2. Developer Settings > GitHub Apps
3. Click 'New GitHub App'
4. Give it a name (ex: SPR Enrollment) and homepage URL (you can just use google here, it doesn't matter)
5. Under Webhook uncheck Active
6. Set the following permissions (set all to read and write)
   - Repository Permissions 
      - Actions, Administration, Contents, Custom Properties, Discussions, Issues, Pull Requests, and Secrets
   - Organization Permissions
      - Secrets
7. Click 'Create GitHub App'

---

## 6. Add App data as Repository Secrets

Now we need to add 2 more secrets related to the App. Lets get the data we need first

1. On GitHub navigate to your enrollment repository's settings, RepositoryNameForCourseEnrollment > Settings
2. Developer Settings > GitHub Apps > Click Edit next to your App created in the previous step
3. Copy the App ID number and save it for the next steps
4. Scroll to the bottom, under the Private Keys sections click Generate a private key
5. When you do so you will see a new key hash generated in the list, ignore this information.
6. Generating the key will also trigger a file to be downloaded to your computer, a pem file. Note where that files is for the next steps

Now that we have the data, lets create our secrets

1. On Github navigate to your enrollment repository's settings, RepositoryNameForCourseEnrollment > Settings
2. Secrets and Variables > Actions
3. Then click 'New Repository Secret'
4. Name the first secret App_ID and paste the App ID copied above in the Secret section.
5. Click 'Add Secret'
6. Then click 'New Repository Secret' again
7. Name this secret APP_PRIVATE_KEY
8. Go to the pem file that was downloaded to your computer in the previous section and open it (notepad/text edit/etc)
9. Copy the entire file including the begin and end lines with all the dashes.
10. Paste that into the Secret section for this new secret
11. Click 'Add Secret'

---

## 7. Configure the Claim Code (Passcode)

The workflow validates a shared "claim code" that students enter when submitting their enrollment issue. The code is stored as a SHA-256 hash in the `EXPECTED_HASH` environment variable inside `provision.yml`.

### Generate a new passcode hash

```bash
printf '%s' "your-secret-passcode" | sha256sum | awk '{print $1}'
```

### Update the workflow

1. Open `.github/workflows/provision.yml`
2. Find the `EXPECTED_HASH` variable (line 16) and replace its value with the hash you generated:

   ```yaml
   EXPECTED_HASH: "your-new-hash-here"
   ```

3. Commit and push the change:

   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/provision.yml
   git commit -m "Update claim code hash for new term"
   git push
   ```

4. Share the **plaintext** passcode with your students (e.g. post it in FSO / the LMS). Never commit the plaintext passcode.

---

## 8. Configure the rest of the provisioning yml

1. Change the ORG_NAME variable (line 15) to your correct organization name.
2. Navigate to line 120 and modify the Labs variable as you need
   - This course has a single repository with all labs for the month in it. If you use multiple repositories you will need to add the different names to this variable separated by a space
   - You will also need to modify the TEMPLATE_REPO and NEW_REPO_NAME variables to match your template repositories and new name to match your course acronym.
   - ex: Your course is RBQ and you have 3 template labs names RBQLab1, RBQBonusLab, and RBQFinalProject
        120 - LABS="Lab1 BonusLab FinalProject"
        128 - TEMPLATE_REPO="RBQ${N}"
        129 -  NEW_REPO_NAME="RBQ_${MONTH_ABBREV}_Labs_${STUDENT_EMAIL_USERNAME}"
3. Commit and push the change:

   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/provision.yml
   git commit -m "Update claim code hash for new term"
   git push
   ```

---

## 9. Populate `hash.db` with Authorized Student Emails

The workflow checks each student's email against `hash.db` before provisioning. Only students whose email hash appears in this file will be authorized.

### Add a single student

```bash
printf '%s' "studentname@student.fullsail.edu" | tr -d '\r' | sed -e 's/^[[:space:]]*//' -e 's/[[:space:]]*$//' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sha256sum | awk '{print $1}' >> hash.db
```

### Bulk add from a file

Create a plain text file (e.g. `students.txt`) with one email per line, then run:

```bash
while IFS= read -r email; do
  printf '%s' "$email" | tr -d '\r' | sed -e 's/^[[:space:]]*//' -e 's/[[:space:]]*$//' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sha256sum | awk '{print $1}' >> hash.db
done < students.txt
```

### Commit the changes

```bash
git add hash.db
git commit -m "Add authorized students for new term"
git push
```

> See `teacher.md` for instructions on removing students and other ongoing maintenance.

---

## 10. Enable GitHub Actions and Workflow Permissions

### Enable Actions

1. Go to the enrollment repo: **Settings > Actions > General**
2. Under **Actions permissions**, select **Allow all actions and reusable workflows**
3. Click **Save**

### Workflow permissions for the `GITHUB_TOKEN`

The `provision.yml` workflow already declares the needed permissions in its `permissions:` block:

```yaml
permissions:
  issues: write
  contents: read
```

However, GitHub also has an org/repo-level setting that can override this. Verify:

1. Go to **Settings > Actions > General** in the enrollment repo
2. Scroll to **Workflow permissions**
3. Ensure **Read and write permissions** is enabled (or that the workflow's inline `permissions:` block is respected)
4. Click **Save**

---

## 11. Verify the Issue Template

The enrollment repo should have a GitHub issue template at `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/student-invite.yml`. This template:

- Is titled "Request Assignment Repository"
- Auto-applies the `provision-repo` label (which triggers the workflow)
- Collects the student's Full Sail email and claim code

If the file is missing or corrupted, restore it from this repository. The `provision-repo` label must exist in the repo for the issue template to apply it:

```bash
gh label create provision-repo --repo FullSailGameStudies/OPSCourseEnrollment --color FBCA04 --description "Triggers the repository provisioning workflow"
```

---

## 12. Test the Workflow

Before announcing to students, test the full flow end-to-end:

1. **Ensure your own email hash is in `hash.db`** (or use a test email)
2. **Know the current claim code** (the plaintext that hashes to `EXPECTED_HASH`)
3. Go to the enrollment repo on GitHub and open a new issue using the "Request Assignment Repository" template
4. Enter a valid Full Sail email and the current claim code
5. Submit the issue

### Expected behavior

- The workflow runs automatically (triggered by the `provision-repo` label on the issue)
- Within a few minutes, you should see:
  - A comment on the issue confirming verification passed
  - Five new private repos created in the org (e.g. `OPS_JUL_Lab3_username`, `OPS_JUL_Lab4_username`, etc.)
  - Each repo has the student added as a collaborator with write access
  - Each repo has topics `ops-student` and `not-graded`
  - Each repo has an `assignment` branch and an open "Grading and Feedback" PR
  - A final comment on the issue with links to all repos, then the issue is closed

### If the workflow fails

- Check the **Actions** tab in the enrollment repo for error logs
- Verify `ORG_ADMIN_TOKEN` is set correctly and has not expired
- Verify the template repos exist and are marked as template repositories
- Verify the claim code hash matches `EXPECTED_HASH`
- Verify the student email hash exists in `hash.db`

---

## 13. Cleanup Workflow (Automatic)

The `cleanup-issues.yml` workflow runs hourly and redacts comments on closed issues older than 30 minutes. This protects student privacy by removing email addresses and repo links that were posted in issue comments.

No additional setup is needed for this workflow — it uses the automatic `GITHUB_TOKEN` and the `issues: write` permission declared in the workflow file.
